## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project implements the Hangman game in Python, where the computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters in the word.

## Installation Instructions
To install this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/qhedroid/hangman36.git

## Usage Instruction
To run the game, use the following command:
1. python milestone_5.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. The game will prompt you to guess letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.

## What You Learned
This project involves:

	•	Understanding and implementing classes and methods in Python.
	•	Using loops and conditionals to control game flow.
	•	Handling user input and validating it.
